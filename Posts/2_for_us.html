	<h1>Digital transformation - tools for us, instead of us and about us! </h1>
	<p class="date">Published: 5 February 2018</p>
	<p class="callout_post">In which I ponder why there is such an increasing focus on legal technology - and nervousness about it - concluding that this is because of the shift in technology's relationship to us - moving from something built  <em>for us</em>, to technology being created to be <em>instead</em> of us and <em>about us</em>. </h2>
  <p>So, what is all this "going digital" about and how does it apply to the law? Not a bad to question to start with on a blog called Jane Goes Digital I guess.</p>
  <p>The first thing we need to get out into the open is that whatever else "going digital" (and I have views that it's more than just the technology) involves it does involve using technology to change the way in which we do things.  Sounds pretty obvious, but there are a few debates going on around this.  Let’s not get too definitionally fixated though with what's "transformation" and what's "digitisation", but simply accept that it's got something to do with changing the way we do things through technology.  Let's just leave it at that!</p>
  <p>I think the next thing we need to get out into the open is the fact that law and legal practice have been “going digital” for years.  The way law was practiced 30 years ago - on typewriters with books and telephones, fax machines and telexes - is certainly very different to today, and although people are running digitisation projects that try and rid the legal world of paper, that all started a long time ago (in technology terms).  We don't, after all, write our documents by hand to be typed up on typewriters!
  <p>Given this, one of the things I’ve been pondering, is, why there is such hype now about technology?   Why such nervousness about the future of lawyers? And why such an explosion in the types of technologies available? </p>
  <p>There are certainly technical reasons why this level of disruption is possible - cloud computing, increasing computer power etc.  There are also commercial reasons why the profession is so keen to find better, faster, cheaper ways of doing things (Richard Susskind’s ‘more for less’ challenge).  There is also of course, the roving eye of venture capital funding forays into this very profitable market; the millennials looking at the way we do things, and thinking it that could be better - or at least different; and the technologists…and so on…</p>
  <p>While this explains the interest - and certainly the capability, it doesn't seem to me fully explain the increased nervousness of the profession in this space now. In my view, there are two additional factors at play. </p>
  <p>Firstly, the nervousness is driven by a shift in the nature of technology's relationship to us.  Secondly, the increased possibilities are driven not merely from the technology itself, but from the approach to the design of the solution. Today, I wanted to talk about that first one - the shift in technology's relationship to us.  </p>
    <p>  For a long time the technology that was available to legal practitioners was there to support them doing their tasks - they were merely <em>enabling</em> technologies.  Now, I think we have three different types of technologies available for us.   They are technologies that are:
    <ol>
     <li><em>for us </em>as legal practitioners - the enablers;</li>
     <li><em>instead of us </em>  - the replacment of us; and </li>
     <li><em>about us </em> - shining a light in on what we do and how we compare. </li>
  </ol>
  </p>
  <h2>Traditional technologies were for us</h2>
  <p>Really, this is a bit of misnomer, as many of the core technologies which we have traditionally used in legal weren’t really built for us at all.  They were just generic tools - like Word - the bread and butter of most legal practitioners technology toolkit.  This was a tool basically designed to enable people - any people - to write and format text.  Legal picked it up, because we write a lot of text. Fundamentally, however, it was a tool that enabled us to do specific tasks which are fundamental to being a lawyer - prepare documents. </p>
  <p>Other traditional technologies - like document management systems or the dreaded practice management systems that record time in 6 minute increments, all enabled tasks that started their life in a paper based world, and importantly, left the thinking tasks to us. </p>
  <h2>Many new technologies are instead of us</h2>
  <p>Technologies that replace us - or at least some of the things we do - starts to be a bit more concerning - if you happen to be a legal practitioner. These technologies started with some fairly innocuous tools that engage in fairly simple rules-based pattern matching to help us do some of the more boring routine tasks involved in our day to day work.  Think of the definition checkers which look for patterns in the words used in your documents to identify potential errors in your definitions. Or <a href="https://www.jade.io/?gclid=CjwKCAiA-9rTBRBNEiwAt0Znw_oudCvUUfErvdHEogeIa4W-9KviIJ0czjKn-0ssQ7hYYPNu0HdUjxoC8jUQAvD_BwE">BarNet Jade</a>, which does an amazing job at finding all the specific citations to a particular case - and if you upload a document - linking all of your citations.  While these are uniquely legal tasks,  at first blush getting technology to do them doesn't really seem that threatening.  They simply look like they are taking some of the more tedious and administrative style legal tasks away from practitioners. So far, not so bad.  Who wants to do those boring bits (junior lawyers possibly)?</p>
  <p> The rise of the DD tools and increasing availability of the eDiscovery tools, starts to look a bit different though.  These tools are essentially looking to identify material which satisfies the legal concept of relevance.  In the eDiscovery space, the tool looks for material relevant to the issues outlined in the pleadings.  In the DD space, it is looking for material which is relevant to assessing legal risk.  These tasks, while not the most fun to do, have typically been done by  legally qualified people - they appear to involve legal thinking and cognition - some form of legal reasoning.  Automating these types of tasks starts to feel like automating not peripheral and boring parts of a lawyers' job, but automating core parts of legal work. </p>
  <p>  If we then add the increasing sophistication of what is variously called legal analytics or computational law,  it starts to look like these emerging tools are not only helping us automate the boring and routine bits of law, but that they are starting to impinge not just on core legal tasks - but on core parts of lawyering - giving legal advice.  And this is particularly scary for the profession when the ‘machines’ are starting to beat humans in predicting the outcomes of cases - see <a href="https://www.lawgazette.co.uk/practice/robot-beats-human-lawyers-in-outcomes-challenge/5063471.article">Robot Beats Human Lawyers in Outcomes Challenge. </a> Predicting outcomes is a core legal skill - based on not just knowledge of the legal rules, but deep experience learned through practice.  If this can be automated, what are the uniquely legal skills which are left?</p>
  <p> Finally, if we throw in a bit of disintermediation by adding the very belated realisation that perhaps we could use this thing called the internet to not only advertise legal services - but actually deliver legal services, in ways which are fairly automated, and it starts to seem as though lawyers are no longer so fully at the centre of "legalling" after all.
  <p> In this context, the assurances that the tools will be taking away the boring work; that they will be merely enabling or supporting us - or ‘augmenting’ us as I saw the other day -  doesn't feel quite as comforting as we would like them to be. </p>
  <h2>Some technologies are about us</h2>
  <p>There is a final set of tools starting to hit the Australian market which are worth  mentioning.    These are the tools which use data to provide insight about legal professionals themselves.  We had a taste for this in the <a href="https://www.premonition.ai/reports/">Premonition</a> report which offers statitistical rankings of firms and barristers based on publicly available data. The Australian start-up <a href="https://jurimetrics.com.au/">Jurimetrics</a> is heading down a similar path.</p>
  <p> This approach to evaluating lawyers' work is a fundamental shift from subjective evaluation of the provision of legal services, to a  data driven one.  This will be really hard for the profession.  Though we have suffered the scrutiny of accounting for our every minute via the billable hour, we haven’t really been assessed <em>quantitatively</em> on the <em>quality</em> of our legal work. This type of analysis of our data changes everything.  In a data driven world, there is  no opportunity to explain that losing a case which had a 50/50 chance of success might not have been bad lawyering - but may have been a carefully crafted strategy involving an assessment of risk.  That strategy may not ultimately have been successful - but it may not necessarily have been bad.  This is a changing world indeed!</p>
  <p>So a changing world for the legal profession.  No longer is the profession the predominant user of legal technology, but it also the object of it also.  A big shift for the profession.  Implicitly, this shift is not just by the technology itself  - but in the approaches taken to technology design - which I will write about later! </p>
  <p>Enjoy everyone!</p>
