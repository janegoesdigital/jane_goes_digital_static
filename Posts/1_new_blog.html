	<h1>Digital transformation - tools for us, instead of us and about us! </h1>
	<p class="date">Published: 31 January 2018</p>
	<p class="callout_post">blah</h2>
  <p>Not a bad to question to start with on a blog called Jane Goes Digital I guess.</p>
  <p>I suppose the first thing we need to get out into the open is that whatever else digital transformation involves – and I have views about this – it involves technology – information technology.  It involves technology changing the way in which we do things.  Let’s not get too definitionally fixated though, but just leave it at that!</p>
  <p>I think the next thing we need to get out into the open is the fact that digital transformation in the legal world has been happening for a long time – longer than some of the people who are reading this blog have been alive.  It is also a bit unusual, as in one sense, law and legal practice have been “going digital” for years.  The way law was practiced 30 years ago – on type writers with books and telephones, fax machines and telexes – is certainly very different to today, and although people are running digitization projects that try and rid the legal world of paper, that started a long time ago (in technology terms) firstly with Word Perfect and then with Microsoft’s word.</p>
  <p>The move from typewriters to digital documents, form paper files to digital files, from paper signatures to eSignatures – these are things which have been happening for a long time. </p>
  <p>One of the things I’ve been pondering, is, given that law and legal practice has been shifting for a long time, why there is such huge hype now?  And why such nervousness about the future of lawyers? </p>
  <p>There are certainly technical reasons why this level of disruption is technically possible – cloud computing, increasing computer power etc.  There are also commercial reasons why the profession is so desperate to find better, faster, cheaper ways of doing things (Richard Susskind’s ‘more for less’ challenge), as well as the roving eye of venture capital funding forays into this very profitable market looking for share.  And then, of course, there are the millennials looking at the way we do things, and thinking – that could be better.  And the technologists…and so on…</p>
  <p>But none of this seems to me fully explain the sense of nervousness in some parts of the profession and the absolute interest in this space now.</p>
  <p>So why now?  As I was pondering this question, it seemed to me that the really important thing which is changing technology’s relationship to us and what we do as lawyers.  What do I mean by that? Well, I think for a long time the technology that was available to legal practitioners, was there to support them doing their tasks – they were enabling technologies  Now, I think we have three different types of technologies available for us.   They are technologies that are:
    <ol>
     <li>For us as legal practitioners;</li>
     <li>instead of us; and </li>
     <li>About us, with this last one not. </li>
  </ol>
  </p>
  <h2>Traditional technologies were for us</h2>
  <p>Really, this is a bit of misnomer, as many of the core technologies which we have traditionally used in legal weren’t really built for us at all.  They were just generic tools – like Word – the bread and butter of most legal practitioners technology toolkit.  This was a tool basically designed to enable people – any people – to write and format text.  Legal picked it up, because we write a lot of text, and in more sophisticated </p>
  <p>But fundamentally, it was a tool that enabled us to do specific tasks which are fundamental to being a lawyer – prepare documents. </p>
  <p>Other traditional technologies – like document management systems or the dreaded practice management systems that record time in 6 minute increments, all enabled tasks that started their life in a paper based world, and left the thinking tasks to us. </p>
  <h2>New technologies are instead of us</h2>
  <p>In this suite of tools – of which there are ever growing numbers, unlike the tools above that were designed to do generic tasks,  the tools are designed to do some tasks that look like legal tasks.  These tools start with the simple tasks that engage in pattern to help us do some of the more boring routine tasks involved in our day to day work.  Think of the definition checkers which look for patterns in the words used in your documents to identify potential errors in your definitions, or Jade, which does an amazing job at finding all the specific citations to a particular case – and if you upload a document – linking all of your citations.  This group of tools start to look a bit like uniquely legal tasks, aren’t really that threatening.  They really do look like they take some of the more tedious and administrative style legal tasks. </p>
  <p>So far, not so bad.  Who wants to do those boring bits (junior lawyers possibly)</p>
  <p>The rise of the DD tools and increasing availability of the eDiscovery tools, starts to look a bit different though.  These tools are essentially looking to identify material which satisfies the legal concept of relevance.  In the eDiscovery space, the tool looks for material relevant to the issues outlined in the pleadings.  In the DD space, it is looking for material which is relevant to assessing legal risk.  Although typically we’ve pushed these tasks down to junior lawyers in the first instance, by and large, we have had legally qualified people, because this is about legal thinking and cognition.</p>
  <p>Add to that the emerging interest in legal analytics or computational law – in both the academic spaces and the VC space, and it starts to look like these emerging tools are not only helping us automate the boring and routine bits of law, but that they are starting impinge on the core parts of lawyering – giving legal advice.  And this is particularly scary for the profession when the ‘machines’ are starting to beat humans in predicting the outcomes of cases – see [insert article] </p>
  <p>This is the category of the tools that are really designed to do legal specific tasks, and that, I believe, engender so much anxiety and debate – particularly about the future role of lawyers .
  In this context, the assurances that the tools will be taking away the boring work; that they will be enabling or supporting us – or ‘augmenting’ us as I saw the other day, don’t feel quite as comforting as we would like them to be. </p>
  <h2>About us</h2>
  <p>There is a final set of tools which is worth a mention, but which is only just starting to hit the Australian legal market, and these are the tools which use data to provide insight about legal professionals themselves.  We had a taste for this in the Premonition report which [blah blah blah]</p>
  <p>Inhouse counsel also use tools to analyse data about legal services. </p>
  <p>I think it’s these last two this for the profession, is a fundamental shift from subjective evaluation of the provision of legal services, to a more data driven one.  And this will be really hard for us.  Though we have suffered the scrutiny of our every minute via the billable hour, we haven’t really been assessed quantitatively on the quality of our legal work – with no opportunity to explain why taking a case that had a 50/50 chance of success and just losing, wasn’t bad lawyering.</p>
  <p>Implicit in this, is of course, a different approach to the design of the technology itself – a whole other topic! </p>
