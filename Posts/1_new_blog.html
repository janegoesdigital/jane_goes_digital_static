	<p class="callout_post">Of my adventures in Trumpland, being a change manager, and pivoting with this blog to ponder all things law and digital.</p>
	<h2>What have I been doing?</h2>
	<p>So my friends, I am back in the blogging saddle - which, I have to admit, is a really weird beginning metaphor!  But where have I been?  Well, I haven’t quite been to London to the visit the Queen, but did spend some time in what used to be called the USA, but now I’m thinking of it as Trumpland.  It was an interesting experience.  I was there both before and after the election, and couldn’t help but talk to lots of people of said election.  There were a number of things which were basically terrifying, not least of which was the fact that the people I met who voted for Trump were genuinely scared that he had won.  More terrifying though was the so-called “post-truth” environment, which to my mind doesn’t really capture the zeitgeist that I experienced.  To me, what seemed to be lacking was not so much an interest in the truth, but the basic skill set of critical thinking to enable likely truth to be separated from likely fiction.  People I talked to could, and did, believe almost anything without really questioning it or evaluating it for likelihood.  From conspiracy theories that involved the entire media, government and corporate apparatus working in concert together for a single goal, to implausible facts such as 75% of Americans are employed by government. </p>

<p>I have also tried my hand at being a change manager for a while.  It was, like all things, an interesting experience.   I’m not sure I was cut out to manage change itself separately from the change being implemented.  To me, they seem intricately entwined, and it’s hard to do one well without the other - but that could be a whole other topic.  Now, I’m back into the swing of law firms, and am working with a delightful group of lawyers to build a KM program.</p>

<h2>My adventures in code?</h2>

<p>But what of my coding adventures I hear you ask?  Well, I’m still adventuring in the world of code.  I’ve narrowed down my focus to the javascript stack and have been perservering with working my way through the so-called MEAN stack - without the “a” bit ie mongo, express and node - no angular.  I’ve been learning React instead, which makes it the MERN stack, but that doesn’t quite sound as interesting as the MEAN stack, so I’m just going to stick with saying MEAN for now.  If all that sounds like goobledygook to you, it’s not that much better to me, but the thing I’ve learnt from coding, is that it’s perservance in the face of the apparently incomprehensible counts! </p>

<p>Oh...and I built this site from scratch. No more wrestling with Wordpress for me!  So I guess I did learn some things when learning to code!  I also learnt that it's addictive - and an ongoing journey. I'm already thinking about how to 're-factor' ie rebuild this site!</p>

<p>And what did I learn from coding adventure - well lots.  I learnt that it’s really hard to learn to code.  It’s a whole new language, and whole new skill.  And like all new languages and skills, it requires practice, practice, practice.  It’s also a whole new way of seeing the world - and for me, it was a lot of fun.  People often ask me whether it was “worth it” and whether all lawyers  - or even everybody - should learn to code.   For me, it was definitely worth it.  It filled and fueled my curiousity, and helps me feel like I’m still relevant in this rapidly transforming world.  It also introduced me to a whole new world of people - devs, designers, start ups - which I found really interesting.  The time spent coding also clarified for me where my interests lay.  Whenever I was asked to build something, sadly, I have to confess, I built something related to law.  It would seem that this legal world is not yet finished with me, and while I’m not practicing anymore, I’m pretty fascinated by the possibilities offered to the legal world by the new digital world. </p>

<h2>So what's next?</h2>

	<p>So me, and my blog are “pivoting” (see I’ve been talking with people in start-ups) towards thinking and writing about KM, law, and the boom in technology and law which is driving so much change in the legal sphere at the moment.</p>
<p>I’m not quite sure what all of this means, or where it will take us, but I’m pretty interested to find out.  And hopefully, we can find out together!</p>
