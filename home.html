		<p> This is my new blog. I am a generation-X lawyer and legal knowledge manager who has learned to code.  As many of you will know, I started blogging initially to record of my journey/struggles in taking some time out and spending 3 months in a class room learning how to code.  This, in itself, was an extension of my passion for designing and implementing legal technology.  For my original blog about learning to code you can see my beautiful Wordpress site. I've come a long way since then - and have built this blog from scratch.  I hope it stays up! </p>

		<p>I see this new blog as a place to record my thoughts about KM, law, and the boom in legal technology which is driving so much change in the legal sphere at the moment - the digital transformation of law.  I'm particularly interested in technologies impact not only on the way we practice law, but how we perceive and do law itself - how is it transforming people's access to law.  Is it transforming people's access to law? </p>

		<p>Jane.Goes.Digital does Law.Goes.Digital if you will.</p>

		<p>I’m not quite sure what all of this means, or where it will take us, but I’m pretty interested to find out.  And hopefully, we can find out together!</p>
		<p>Enjoy!</p>
